The Car Rental Management project offers a comprehensive set of features aimed at facilitating the seamless rental process for both customers and car rental agencies:

Registration Pages:

Customers and car rental agencies have distinct registration pages tailored to their specific requirements. This ensures that the registration process is optimized for each user group, providing a smooth onboarding experience.
Login Pages:

Users are provided with either a single login page or separate login pages, depending on whether they are customers or car rental agencies. This ensures that users are directed to the appropriate interface upon login, enhancing usability and security.
Add New Cars Page:

Car rental agencies, upon logging in, gain access to a dedicated page where they can effortlessly add details of new cars available for rental. Key details such as vehicle model, vehicle number, seating capacity, and rent per day are captured. Additionally, agencies have the capability to edit the details of existing cars, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information.
Available Cars to Rent Page:

This feature-rich page displays all available cars for rent, presenting essential details such as vehicle model, vehicle number, seating capacity, and rent per day.
Customers have the flexibility to select the number of days they require the car and specify the start date through intuitive dropdown menus.
A prominent "Rent Car" button facilitates the booking process. Importantly, this page is accessible to all users, irrespective of their login status.
Upon clicking the "Rent Car" button, only logged-in customers can proceed to book the car. If a user is not logged in, they are seamlessly redirected to the login page to authenticate their booking request.
Car rental agencies are restricted from booking available cars, ensuring that customer bookings are prioritized and agency functionalities remain focused on management tasks.
Car Agency 'View Booked Cars' Page:

Car rental agencies have access to a dedicated page where they can view a comprehensive list of customers who have booked a particular car added by them. This functionality provides valuable insights into the booking history associated with each car, enabling agencies to efficiently manage their rental operations and make informed decisions regarding fleet management and availability.
